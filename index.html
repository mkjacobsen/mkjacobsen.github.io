							<h2 class="major">Mission Command System Analysis</h2>
							<p>
								During my time at the Institute for Defense Analyses, my core analytical area involved mission command systems.  These
								systems involve multiple aspects of data availability across echelons and battlefields, including situational awareness
								data (e.g. where others are located and moving to and what they see) and command functions (e.g. creating and issuing orders).
								As a central part of this type of assessment, I developed techniques for parsing, matching, and reporting on electronic data and messages
								as they move between locations and appear to users.  In my data portfolio, you will find a set of walkthroughs describing and demonstrating
								how some of this process is accomplished.
							</p>  
							<p>
								In addition to the technical analysis described in the data portfolio, I have also created modules for:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li><a href="#mapdataextraction">Graphical Data Extraction</a></li>
								<li>Automated parsing of message content</li>
								<li>Content accuracy and delivery timeliness analysis</li>

							<h2 class="major">Graphical Data Extraction</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/mde.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In the assessment of Mission Command tools, one of the capabilities required is to extract data present on visual map
								tools or other graphical representations. With some clever use of Python packages, I have developed and implemented
								a tool package capable of enabling the user to extract this information in a simple way, using their mouse and computer.</p>

							<p>This method makes use of the MGRS, Open-CV, and Pillow packages within Python and uses two user-defined reference points on the image
								to establish graphical conversions for the data on the map.  The user can then identify as many graphical items on the map as they
								wish and the program will store these and convert them.  </p>

							<p>The intent of such a tool is to make the graphical data available visually, available for quantitative analysis when compared with data
								from other sources.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Test Incident Report Analysis</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/tira.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								One important component of system analysis is the collective metrics associated with Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability. 
								In the Army related operational assessments of this type, documents referred to as Test Incident Reports (TIRs) are used to document various failures
								and used to determine each of these values.
							</p>

							<p>
								However, these TIRs are simple text documents, which makes data handling and analysis difficult. In order to facilitate a simpler analysis and data centralization
								this project involved creating a data pipeline to ingest these text documents, perform some rudimentary calculations, and build a toolset for a more general user to employ.
								Using the wxPython framework, the ingestion is accomplished via a GUI interface that cleans and formats the TIR data into spreadsheet and word document forms, depending on the data.
								These are annotated and can be used iteratively during test events to monitor data quality and maintain notations.
							</p>

							<p>
								Beyond this, some tutorial overviews are included in my Data Science Portfolio repository on GitHub discussing how to take some strawman data and 
								clean and prepare it. In the near future, overviews pertaining to the ingestion of data, graphing and reporting on this data will be uploaded.
